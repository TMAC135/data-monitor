## About this Project

The objective for this project is collecting some useful information on the web and mining the potential relation behind these data. Finally, we will present the result of the analysis on the web.

### Main Components
- Web Crawler
  - CNN news
  - Housing price in big cities like Beijing, ShangHai
  - Other interesting topics
- Data Analysis  
  - Using python science packages: Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib to preprocess the
raw data from previous step
  - Using python sklearn package and apply machine learning algorithms to build the
  model
  - For new data, present the predicted result
- Presentation
  - The total project is based on the microframework in python - flask, the users will easily negate to any module they like
  - Possibly add some permission management

### Functionality for each package
